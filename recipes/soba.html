    <h2>How to make Cold Soba Noodles</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Prior to cooking the noodles have a large bowl of ice water handy, with plenty of ice. </li>
        <li>Bring a large pot of water to a boil, and salt it. Cook noodles until tender but not mushy. Once the noodles are to taste, quickly drain and plunge into the ice water.</li>
        <li>Combine dashi or stock, soy sauce and mirin. Taste, and add a little more soy if the flavor is not strong enough. Serve noodles with garnishes, with sauce on side for dipping (or spooning over).</li>
